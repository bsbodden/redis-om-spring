# Lombok configuration for tests module

# Note: @NonNull on primitive types generates warnings but is used intentionally
# to include primitive fields in @RequiredArgsConstructor.
# These warnings are expected and can be ignored as they don't affect functionality.
# The primitives are used in test fixtures where we want them included in the
# constructor for test data setup.
